## Installation

### Using Homebrew

```bash
brew tap malhotra-rishabh/boogiewoogie
brew install boogiewoogie
```

### Manual Installation

1. Download the script:
   ```bash
   curl -o ~/boogiewoogie https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malhotra-rishabh/boogiewoogie/main/boogiewoogie
   ```

2. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/boogiewoogie
   ```

3. Move to a directory in your PATH:
   ```bash
   sudo mv ~/boogiewoogie /usr/local/bin/
   ```

## Usage

### Add a New Profile

```bash
boogiewoogie add
```

This will interactively prompt you for:
- Profile name (e.g., personal, work)
- Git user name
- Git email
- Git host (e.g., github.com, gitlab.com)
- **SSH host alias** (e.g., github-personal, github-work; must be unique)
- SSH key path (optional, defaults to ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_[profile-name])

> **Note:** The SSH host alias must be unique for each profile. If you try to add a profile with an alias that already exists, BoogieWoogie will show an error and prevent the addition.

The script will:
- Save your profile
- Offer to generate a new SSH key if it doesn't exist
- Show the public key for adding to your Git host
- Suggest an alias for easy switching
- Show instructions for using the SSH alias in your Git remote URLs

### Using SSH Host Aliases in Git Remotes

When you have multiple profiles for the same host (e.g., github.com), use the SSH alias in your remote URLs. For example:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github-personal:username/repo.git
# or
git clone git@github-work:username/repo.git
```

This ensures the correct SSH key and profile are used for each account.

### List All Profiles

```bash
boogiewoogie list
```

Shows all configured profiles with the current active profile marked with an asterisk (*).

### Switch Profiles

```bash
boogiewoogie switch <profile-name>
```

This will:
- Verify SSH key existence
- Update your global Git configuration
- Create a backup of your existing SSH config
- Update your SSH configuration (with all SSH aliases)
- Restart the SSH agent with the correct key
- Test connection to the Git host via the alias
- Show detailed status information, including the SSH alias to use

### Show Current Profile

```bash
boogiewoogie current
```

Displays detailed information about the currently active Git profile.

### Remove a Profile

```bash
boogiewoogie remove <profile-name>
```

Removes a profile from the configuration and updates the SSH config accordingly.

### Version Information

```bash
boogiewoogie version
```

Shows the current version of BoogieWoogie.

## Setting Up Aliases

After adding profiles, you can create aliases for quick switching. Add these to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
alias git-personal='boogiewoogie switch personal'
alias git-work='boogiewoogie switch work'
```

## Configuration Storage

- Profiles are stored in `~/.boogiewoogie/profiles.conf`
- SSH configuration is managed in `~/.ssh/config`
- SSH config backups are created automatically with timestamps
- All sensitive files are created with appropriate permissions (600)

## Example Workflow

1. Add your personal profile:
   ```bash
   boogiewoogie add
   # Enter details for personal GitHub account
   # Use SSH alias: github-personal
   ```

2. Add your work profile:
   ```bash
   boogiewoogie add
   # Enter details for work GitHub account
   # Use SSH alias: github-work
   ```

3. Switch between profiles as needed:
   ```bash
   boogiewoogie switch personal  # For personal projects
   boogiewoogie switch work      # For work projects
   ```

4. Update your Git remote URLs to use the correct alias:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github-personal:username/repo.git
   git remote set-url origin git@github-work:username/repo.git
   ```

## Security Features

- SSH keys are managed securely with appropriate permissions
- SSH configs are generated with `IdentitiesOnly yes` to prevent key leakage
- Configuration files are stored in user's home directory with restricted permissions
- Automatic backup of SSH configuration before changes
- Verification of SSH key existence before switching
- Connection testing after profile switch
- Secure handling of SSH agent operations

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check current profile and SSH alias:
   ```bash
   boogiewoogie current
   ```

2. Verify SSH key is loaded:
   ```bash
   ssh-add -l
   ```

3. Test SSH connection using the alias:
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github-personal  # For personal GitHub
   ssh -T git@github-work      # For work GitHub
   ```

4. Check SSH config backups:
   ```bash
   ls -l ~/.ssh/config.*  # List all SSH config backups
   ```

5. Common Issues:
   - If SSH key addition fails, check key permissions (should be 600)
   - If host connection fails, verify the host key acceptance
   - If profile switch fails, ensure SSH key exists at specified path
